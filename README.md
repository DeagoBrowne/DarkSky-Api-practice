# DarkSky-Api-practice

I attempted to create a Weather App using a tutorial on Dark Sky API.
I later found out that the site was no longer accepting sign ups, and so substituted DarkSky for Open Weather API.

I was successfully able to call the API, but have so far been unable to utilize the information.

Still I thought it was worth posting the attempt.

I someone can help me finish this, I would appreciate it.
