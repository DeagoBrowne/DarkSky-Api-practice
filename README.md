# DarkSky-Api-practice

I attempted to create a Weather App using a tutorial on Dark Sky API.
I later found out that the site was no longer accepting sign ups, and so substituted DarkSky for Open Weather API.

I was successfully able to call the API, ~~but have so far been unable to utilize the information.

By default, Open Weather gives a temperature reading in *Kelvin* - so I converted it to **Celcius** (-273.15).
